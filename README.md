# Babbel

Headless REST API for generating audio news bulletins. Combines news stories with station jingles to create ready-to-air audio files for radio automation systems.

## Overview

Babbel is a headless API-only system designed for integration with newsroom workflows and radio automation systems. It provides a comprehensive REST API for managing stations, voices, stories, and automated bulletin generation with station-specific audio branding.

**Key Design Principles:**
- API-first architecture - no built-in UI
- Multi-station support with individual branding
- RFC 9457 Problem Details error handling
- Session-based and OAuth authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **RESTful API** - Complete REST API with OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification
- **Multi-station support** - Manage multiple radio stations with individual configurations
- **Voice management** - Multiple newsreaders with station-specific jingles
- **Story scheduling** - Date ranges and weekday-specific scheduling
- **Bulletin generation** - Automated audio mixing with intelligent caching
- **Direct audio URLs** - Radio automation systems can fetch bulletins directly

### Technical Features
- **Authentication** - Local auth with bcrypt or OIDC/OAuth2 (Microsoft Entra ID, Google, Okta)
- **Authorization** - Role-based access control with Casbin (admin, editor, viewer roles)
- **Audio processing** - FFmpeg-based mixing with configurable mix points
- **Error handling** - RFC 9457 Problem Details for consistent error responses
- **Soft delete** - Stories and users support soft deletion with restoration
- **Session management** - Secure encrypted cookie sessions
- **CORS support** - Configurable cross-origin resource sharing

## Installation

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for installation instructions.

## Newsroom Workflow

1. **Setup**: Configure your stations and newsreaders
2. **Upload jingles**: Add station-specific intro/outro jingles
3. **Create stories**: Upload or POST news items with scheduling info
4. **Generate**: API creates bulletins with appropriate jingles
5. **Broadcast**: Automation systems fetch bulletins via HTTP

## Radio Automation Integration

Automation systems can fetch the latest bulletin directly:
```
GET /api/v1/stations/{station_id}/bulletins?latest=true
```

Returns a WAV file ready for broadcast. Most automation systems can schedule HTTP audio downloads.

### Compatible Systems

- mAirList (HTTP audio source)
- RadioDJ (URL tracks)
- PlayoutONE (Network audio)
- StationPlaylist (Remote files)
- RTV AudioDownload Tool
- Any system that supports HTTP audio

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- 2GB RAM minimum
- 20GB disk space
- Linux server recommended

## API Documentation

- **OpenAPI Specification**: Complete OpenAPI 3.0.3 spec in `openapi.yaml`
- **Interactive Docs**: Available at `/docs` when running locally
- **Base URL**: `/api/v1/`
- **Authentication**: Session cookies or OAuth2
- **Content Types**: `application/json` for most endpoints, `multipart/form-data` for file uploads
